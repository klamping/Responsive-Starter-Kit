# Responsive Starter Kit

## Overview

A stripped down, but highly functional, toolkit to help jump-start a typical responsive web design project.

Plugins and polyfills can be easily added to include support for features such as data tables, content carousels, embedded videos, modal dialogs, touch detection, etc. As well, all CSS is included without the aid of a CSS pre-processor (LESS, Sass, others). This is a bare bones starter kit to help you get started. Those handy items can be added later as needed.

There's a basic *theme.css* file in the *assets/css* directory. Feel free to edit, or even delete, this file as needed. It's been included for demonstration purposes only. It's not intended to influence visual and/or user experience design preferences.
